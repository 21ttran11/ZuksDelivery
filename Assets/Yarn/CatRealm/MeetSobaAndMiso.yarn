Miso: You lost your toy yesterday, cried a river, but then you found it. Now, you’ve lost it again? Dumbass.
Soba: Can’t you have more sympathy for me? I’m in mourning…again. I lost my boy.
Miso: If I had a dollar for every time you lost him, I could buy another kingdom. And I could leave. I could be free!
